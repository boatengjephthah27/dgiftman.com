                        Abstract: Africa, as a continent, experiences violence during its election years. This violence maybe as a result of the low number of electoral facilities to service the high number of eligible voters. Election centers are often characterized by long queues with the election process getting late into the night. This research seeks to identify areas of high population so as to concentrate electoral facilities in these areas. The study identifies the relationship between population densities and polling stations. Population density data, polling station and Greater Accra districts data was used in the analysis. Coordinates for the polling stations were obtained from Google Maps and used together with the Greater Accra district shapefile to create constituency boundaries. The data was then analyzed to identify the trends and dependency level of polling stations on population. The study showed that there is a direct relationship between population and the total number of polling stations as an increase in population led to a relative increase in polling stations in 2008 and 2016 which had a population average of 3,728,783 and 4,916,031 and average polling station of 91.1 and 140.1 respectively. To have a smooth and peaceful voting process, population of an electoral area should have a major influence in the citing and allocation of the number of polling stations.

                        Abstract: The urban structure of most cities has deteriorated over time as a result of inadequate urban planning in these places. Poor planning has been exacerbated by the surge in population, which has increased the need for land for social, economic, and cultural objectives. These factors have an impact on the urban morphology and urban forms of cities. Hence, the need to examine the urban morphology in these areas and analyze the changes that have occurred through time. The study, therefore, seeks to examine the urban morphology of Northern Greater Accra, while characterizing and mapping the various morphological types. This study examined the various types of urban morphology and how this influences accessibility in the study area. In this context, accessibility refers to how easily people can reach the commodities and services they require to meet their basic needs. In addition, this study broadly focuses on accessibility to economic, social, and cultural services. Analysis of population demographics, examination of modes of transportation, and other methodologies was used to draw the connections between urban morphology and accessibility. The findings of this study can be used in city planning to promote accessibility.

                        Abstract: Electoral area mapping is essential in elections. Countries like the USA and UK employ election geodatabase by using Geographic Inforamtion System (GIS) to analyze and take decisions on electoral issues. Many African countries like Ghana are facing the problem of lack of availability of geodatabase on election which makes the political parties, election organizers and the general public unaware of issues concerning elections in Central region. This study addressed the problem of unavailability of election data on polling center basis by gathering and collating election data in Central region of Ghana. We assessed historical data on elections in Ghana's central region, investigated changes in electoral boundaries and constituencies, and compared district borders to constituency boundaries. To test the hypothesis, data for 2008, 2012 and 2016 election were analyzed. The data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel, QGIS and the R Statistical Software. The study's findings indicated that there were fluctuations in total vote cast in the various election years. Also, it was revealed that there were changes in the electoral boundaries due to increase in population growth. The study concludes that there has been an overall fluctuation in voter turnout in the study region. In addition, the polling stations in the study area were not equitably distributed and their locations are difficult to be verified which has the potential to underserve some populations. The study recommends that the Electoral Commission of Ghana should add more polling stations and also get the location of the polling station close to the electorates since some individuals were unable to vote because polling stations were located far away from them and the tension and long queue at the various polling stations during election. The voter population continues to grow, necessitating the addition of more polling locations in order to relieve strain during elections.
