                        Abstract: Africa, as a continent, experiences violence during its election years. This violence maybe as a result of the low number of electoral facilities to service the high number of eligible voters. Election centers are often characterized by long queues with the election process getting late into the night. This research seeks to identify areas of high population so as to concentrate electoral facilities in these areas. The study identifies the relationship between population densities and polling stations. Population density data, polling station and Greater Accra districts data was used in the analysis. Coordinates for the polling stations were obtained from Google Maps and used together with the Greater Accra district shapefile to create constituency boundaries. The data was then analyzed to identify the trends and dependency level of polling stations on population. The study showed that there is a direct relationship between population and the total number of polling stations as an increase in population led to a relative increase in polling stations in 2008 and 2016 which had a population average of 3,728,783 and 4,916,031 and average polling station of 91.1 and 140.1 respectively. To have a smooth and peaceful voting process, population of an electoral area should have a major influence in the citing and allocation of the number of polling stations.

                        Abstract: The urban structure of most cities has deteriorated over time as a result of inadequate urban planning in these places. Poor planning has been exacerbated by the surge in population, which has increased the need for land for social, economic, and cultural objectives. These factors have an impact on the urban morphology and urban forms of cities. Hence, the need to examine the urban morphology in these areas and analyze the changes that have occurred through time. The study, therefore, seeks to examine the urban morphology of Northern Greater Accra, while characterizing and mapping the various morphological types. This study examined the various types of urban morphology and how this influences accessibility in the study area. In this context, accessibility refers to how easily people can reach the commodities and services they require to meet their basic needs. In addition, this study broadly focuses on accessibility to economic, social, and cultural services. Analysis of population demographics, examination of modes of transportation, and other methodologies was used to draw the connections between urban morphology and accessibility. The findings of this study can be used in city planning to promote accessibility.

                        Abstract: Electoral area mapping is essential in elections. Countries like the USA and UK employ election geodatabase by using Geographic Inforamtion System (GIS) to analyze and take decisions on electoral issues. Many African countries like Ghana are facing the problem of lack of availability of geodatabase on election which makes the political parties, election organizers and the general public unaware of issues concerning elections in Central region. This study addressed the problem of unavailability of election data on polling center basis by gathering and collating election data in Central region of Ghana. We assessed historical data on elections in Ghana's central region, investigated changes in electoral boundaries and constituencies, and compared district borders to constituency boundaries. To test the hypothesis, data for 2008, 2012 and 2016 election were analyzed. The data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel, QGIS and the R Statistical Software. The study's findings indicated that there were fluctuations in total vote cast in the various election years. Also, it was revealed that there were changes in the electoral boundaries due to increase in population growth. The study concludes that there has been an overall fluctuation in voter turnout in the study region. In addition, the polling stations in the study area were not equitably distributed and their locations are difficult to be verified which has the potential to underserve some populations. The study recommends that the Electoral Commission of Ghana should add more polling stations and also get the location of the polling station close to the electorates since some individuals were unable to vote because polling stations were located far away from them and the tension and long queue at the various polling stations during election. The voter population continues to grow, necessitating the addition of more polling locations in order to relieve strain during elections.

                        Abstract: In advanced countries, election geodatabase is used to analyze and take decisions on electoral issues such as the trends in the election results, increase in voter population, and changes in electoral boundaries. Ghana today faces the problem of this unavailability of the geodatabase on the election in the country which makes the public unaware of issues concerning elections in their respective areas. This study seeks to analyze the trends, patterns, and changes in boundary demarcation of the study area. Trend studies, the retrospective-prospective study design was used in the study. Northern, Northeast, and Savanna regions were selected for the study. The analysis in the study was based on 2008, 2012, and 2016 election years in the area. The study included both secondary and primary data. The data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel, QGIS, and SPSS software. The study revealed that between the 2008 and 2012 elections, there was a 5% increase in the number of polling stations and 19.4% between 2012 and 2016. Also, the highest voter population in the constituencies was revealed in the results to be 85% of the overall population whiles the lowest voter population was also 80.5% of the overall population in some constituencies. According to the findings of the study, the voter population is increasing, but some people remain hesitant to vote in elections. This was also because there was a deficit of polling stations in some constituencies in the study area. The study recommended that more polling stations should be created within each constituency in the study area. Also, it is recommended that election data in both the constituencies and the polling stations should be made available to the public for easy access. Support should also be given to researchers to conduct more research on the election in the context of Ghana and to be able to map all polling stations in the study area and in the country as a whole.

                        Abstract: Between 1992 and 2020, Ghana held eight democratic elections that resulted in a peaceful transfer of power between political parties. Elections held are a form of democracy as it gives citizens the mandate to exercise their right through voting to elect their leaders both at the presidential and parliamentary levels. In most countries, including Ghana, peaceful elections have led to a democratic and stable environment. However there has been some trend and pattern of voting since the beginning of the fourth republic. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has many capabilities and one of those is facilitating the creation electoral area boundaries, this helps in studying the changes in the electoral area boundaries. Electoral area boundaries since the beginning of the fourth republic has not been the same, an approach to determining the changes in the electoral area boundaries is the use of GIS. Electoral boundaries serve as a link between people in a geographic location and their representatives which allows the governed to hold their representatives accountable. The study investigated the trends of voting in the Ashanti Region of Ghana and also the electoral boundary change in the Ashanti Region across 2008, 2012 and 2020 election years. The study used secondary data which were obtained from the Department of Geography and Rural Development KNUST, some from articles, books and the online sources.
