                    Abstract: Africa, as a continent, experiences violence during its election years. This violence maybe as a result of the low number of electoral facilities to service the high number of eligible voters. Election centers are often characterized by long queues with the election process getting late into the night. This research seeks to identify areas of high population so as to concentrate electoral facilities in these areas. The study identifies the relationship between population densities and polling stations. Population density data, polling station and Greater Accra districts data was used in the analysis. Coordinates for the polling stations were obtained from Google Maps and used together with the Greater Accra district shapefile to create constituency boundaries. The data was then analyzed to identify the trends and dependency level of polling stations on population. The study showed that there is a direct relationship between population and the total number of polling stations as an increase in population led to a relative increase in polling stations in 2008 and 2016 which had a population average of 3,728,783 and 4,916,031 and average polling station of 91.1 and 140.1 respectively. To have a smooth and peaceful voting process, population of an electoral area should have a major influence in the citing and allocation of the number of polling stations.
