h3>BRIEF SUMMARY</h3>
            <P>
                I study hydrological processes and physical interactions in the natural and human environments to better understand and manage water resources through advanced measurements and innovative modeling procedures. 
            </P>
            <p>This has allowed me to investigate:</p> 
            <p>(i) hydro-climate processes to improve sustainable water management; </p>
            <p>(ii) data-model synthesis involving data assimilation and forecasting methods, and</p>
            <p>(iii) uncertainty estimation for a range of datasets and processes. </p>
             <p>
            My research integrates several analytical approaches including hydrological and land surface modeling, environmental modeling and analysis, remote sensing, data assimilation, geospatial data analysis, complex systems, data mining, evolutionary algorithms, and multi-objective methods. 
            Additional interests span Geospatial Information Science and Technology, transport and mobility research, health geography, transport relations with health and the environment, and urban dynamics
